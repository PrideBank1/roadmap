# Tatum public roadmap

In this repository, you can find the [official Tatum public product roadmap](https://github.com/tatumio/roadmap/projects/1). Our product roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you.

## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

- A **release phase** that describes the next expected phase of the roadmap item. See below for a guide to release phases.

- A **feature area** that indicates the area of the product to which the item belongs. For a list of current product areas, see below.

- One or more **product SKU** labels that indicate which product SKUs we expect the feature to be available in. For a list of current product SKUs, see below.

- Once a feature is delivered, the **shipped** label will be applied to the roadmap issue and the issue will be closed.

## Release phases

Release phases indicate the stages that the product or feature goes through, from early testing to general availability.

- **alpha:** *Primarily for testing and feedback*\
Limited availability, requires pre-release agreement. Features still under heavy development, and subject to change. Not for production use, and no documentation, SLAs or support provided.

- **beta:** *Publicly available in full or limited capacity*\
Features mostly complete and documented. Timeline and requirements for GA usually published. No SLAs or support provided.

- **ga:** *Generally available to all customers*\
Ready for production use with associated SLA and technical support obligations.

Some of our features may still be in the exploratory stages, and have no timeframe available. These are included in the roadmap only for early feedback. These are marked as follows:

- **in design:**\
Feature in discovery phase. We have decided to build this feature, but are still figuring out _how_.

- **exploring:**\
Feature under consideration. We are considering building this feature, and gathering feedback on it.

## Roadmap stages

The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. Every product or feature is added to a particular project board column according to the quarter in which it is expected to ship next. Be sure to read the [disclaimer](#disclaimer) below since the roadmap is subject to change, especially further out on the timeline.  You'll also find an **Under Consideration** column, which is used in conjunction with the **in design** and **exploring** release phase labels for when no timeframe is yet available.

## Feature Areas

The following is a list of our current product areas:

- **core:** Improving the API core features
- **blockchains:** Blockchain integration
- **devtools:** Client libraries and other tools
- **security & compliance:** Security and compliance features
- **community:** Community and social features
- **learning:** Education and learning features

_More labels will be added in the future as needed._
